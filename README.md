# IdealityFactorAlgorithm

This algorithm can take in multiple pn junction diode characteristics data and calculate ideality factors, based on the current desnity input and plot graphs, coupled with the linear fit for the ideality factor on the plot. It also outputs the voltage value at which the measurement of the ideality factor was taken.
